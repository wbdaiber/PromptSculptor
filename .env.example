# Development Notes:
# - In development, some security features are relaxed
# - If ADMIN_API_KEY is not set in development, a default key 'dev-api-key-123' is available

# □ API keys are fresh and haven't been committed to git
# □ CORS_ORIGINS is restricted to your actual domain(s)
# □ All secrets are stored in a secure secret management system
