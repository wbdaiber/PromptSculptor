> in security_implementation.md what is the purpose of 
  adding an admin api key and session secret? how will 
  i see this in the app when the app is in production?

⏺ I'll help you understand the security implementation
  by examining the security_implementation.md file to
  explain the purpose of the admin API key and session
  secret, and how they work in production.

⏺ Read(security_implementation.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

⏺ Let me search for this file in the project directory
  to locate it:

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/*security*")
  ⎿  Found 18 files (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I found the SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md file.
   Let me read it:

⏺ Read(PromptSculptor/SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
  ⎿  Read 555 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
  ⎿  PromptSculptor/CLAUDE.md

⏺ Perfect! Now I understand the security
  implementation. Let me explain the purpose of the
  admin API key and session secret, and how they work
  in production.

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Admin API Key & Session Secret serve distinct 
  security purposes:
  1. Admin API Key protects expensive AI endpoints from
   abuse
  2. Session Secret would secure user sessions (not
  fully implemented yet)
  3. Both prevent unauthorized access that could cost
  thousands in AI API fees
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Purpose of Admin API Key and Session Secret

  🔐 Admin API Key (ADMIN_API_KEY)

  Primary Purpose:
  - Cost Protection: Prevents unlimited abuse of
  expensive AI APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic)
  - Access Control: Ensures only authorized users can
  generate prompts
  - Security Gate: First line of defense against API
  abuse attacks

  How it works in production:
  The admin API key is required for all sensitive
  operations, particularly:
  - POST /api/prompts/generate - The expensive AI
  prompt generation endpoint
  - DELETE /api/prompts/:id - Data modification
  operations

  In Production, you won't "see" the API key visually 
  in the app interface - it works behind the scenes:

  1. Server Validation: Every API request must include
  the key in headers (X-API-Key)
  2. Client Integration: The frontend automatically
  includes it in all API calls
  3. Transparent to Users: End users never see or
  interact with the API key directly
  4. Security Headers: Requests without valid keys get
  401 Unauthorized

  🔒 Session Secret (SESSION_SECRET)

  Primary Purpose:
  - Session Security: Signs and encrypts user session
  data
  - State Management: Secures server-side session
  storage
  - CSRF Protection: Prevents cross-site request
  forgery attacks

  Note: Based on the current implementation in
  SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md, the session secret is
  prepared but not fully utilized yet - the app
  primarily uses API key authentication rather than
  user sessions.

  How You'll See This in Production

  User Experience:

  - Users interact with the web interface normally
  - All API calls happen automatically with proper
  authentication
  - No visible API key fields or session management UI
  - Seamless experience with security working
  transparently

  What Actually Happens:

  // Behind the scenes in production:
  // 1. User visits the web app
  // 2. Frontend loads with VITE_API_KEY from 
  environment
  // 3. Every API call includes authentication:
  const response = await fetch('/api/prompts/generate',
   {
    headers: {
      'X-API-Key': 'your-production-api-key',  // 
  Invisible to user
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(promptData)
  });

  Security in Action:

  - Rate Limiting: Users see "Please wait before trying
   again" after 10 AI requests/minute
  - Authentication Errors: If API key is
  missing/invalid, users see "Authentication required"
  - Transparent Protection: Security works without user
   intervention

  Production Deployment Evidence:

  You'll know it's working by:
  1. Environment Variables Set: API keys configured in
  your hosting platform
  2. Security Headers: Response headers include 15+
  security headers
  3. Rate Limiting Active: Requests get throttled
  appropriately
  4. API Protection: Unauthorized requests return 401
  errors
  5. No Stack Traces: Errors show sanitized messages,
  not system details

  The security is designed to be invisible to 
  legitimate users but impenetrable to attackers. Users
   get the full functionality while the app prevents
  the $1000s in potential AI API abuse that was
  possible before these security measures were
  implemented.
