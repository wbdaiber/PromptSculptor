- Missing session storage schema integration
- DatabaseStorage class complexity amplified by admin features (700+ lines)
- Inefficient admin query patterns performing multiple separate database calls
- Missing performance indexes for admin analytics workloads

### âœ… Issues Resolved
- All critical performance indexes added and applied
- Session storage schema fully integrated
- DatabaseStorage class refactored (reduced from 702 to 257 lines - 63% reduction)
- Service architecture implemented with specialized services
- TypeScript compilation errors fixed across all services
- Admin analytics endpoints integrated with optimized CTE queries
