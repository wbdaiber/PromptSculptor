# Refactoring Plan: User-Aware Prompt Generation with Smart Fallback

## Architecture Overview

Transform prompt generation to prioritize user-specific API keys while maintaining a demo mode for new users to explore the product without requiring API keys.

## Phase 1: Create User-Aware API Manager

### 1. New file: `server/services/userApiKeyManager.ts`
- Create service that retrieves user-specific API keys from database
- Initialize AI clients dynamically per request with user's decrypted keys
- Implement secure caching with TTL for performance
- Return null when no user key exists (triggers fallback)

### 2. API Key Priority System:
```
1. User's own API key (from database) - PRIMARY
2. Demo mode (no API required) - FALLBACK for new/trial users
3. Environment variables - ONLY for system admin use (optional)
```

## Phase 2: Refactor Prompt Generation Service

### 1. Modify `server/services/promptGenerator.ts`
- Add parameters: `userId?`, `dbStorage?` 
- Check for user API keys first
- Fall back to enhanced demo mode if no keys available
- Improve demo templates to be actually useful

### 2. Enhanced Demo Mode:
- High-quality template-based generation
- Clear indication it's a demo result
- Prompt to add API keys for better results
- Support all template types with realistic examples

## Phase 3: Smart Fallback Strategy

### 1. Demo Mode Triggers:
- New user without API keys → Demo mode with onboarding hints
- Registered user without specific service key → Demo with "Add [Service] key" message
- API key error/expired → Demo with error explanation
- Explicit demo request → Allow users to preview without using credits

### 2. Demo Mode Features:
- Generate quality example prompts based on templates
- Show "Generated with Demo Mode" indicator
- Include call-to-action to add API keys
- Maintain same response structure as API calls

## Phase 4: Route Handler Updates

### 1. Modify `/api/prompts/generate` in `server/routes.ts`
```typescript
// Pseudo-code flow
if (user.authenticated) {
  userKey = await getUserApiKey(userId, targetModel)
  if (userKey) {
    result = generateWithUserKey(userKey, request)
  } else {
    result = generateDemoPrompt(request, {
      message: `Add your ${targetModel} API key for AI-powered generation`
    })
  }
} else {
  result = generateDemoPrompt(request, {
    message: "Sign up to save prompts and use your own API keys"
  })
}
```

## Phase 5: User Experience Enhancements

### 1. API Key Status Indicators:
- Dashboard showing configured services
- Visual indicators for which models are available
- Credits/usage tracking per API key

### 2. Progressive Disclosure:
- Start with demo → Show quality difference → Encourage API key addition
- Comparison view: "Demo vs AI-Generated" examples
- Trial period with limited API calls using system keys (optional)

## Phase 6: Environment Variables Role

### Production Architecture:
- **User Operations**: Always use database-stored user keys
- **Demo Mode**: No API keys needed, template-based
- **System Admin** (optional): 
  - `.env` keys for monitoring/testing
  - Premium trial offers using system keys
  - NOT used for regular user operations

## Implementation Order

1. Create UserApiKeyManager service
2. Enhance demo mode with better templates
3. Update prompt generator with user context
4. Modify route handlers for user-aware flow
5. Add fallback messaging system
6. Create API key status dashboard
7. Add demo vs real comparison feature
8. Write tests for all scenarios
9. Update documentation

## Benefits of This Hybrid Architecture

- **Better Onboarding**: Users can try the product immediately without API keys
- **User Ownership**: Registered users primarily use their own keys
- **Graceful Degradation**: System works even without any API keys
- **Clear Upgrade Path**: Demo → Add API Key → Full features
- **Cost Control**: Users manage their own API costs
- **Flexibility**: Supports free tier (demo) and paid tier (API keys)

## Example User Flows

### New Visitor:
1. Enters natural language → Gets demo prompt
2. Sees "Generated with Demo Mode - Add API key for better results"
3. Can test all features with template-based responses
4. Encouraged to sign up and add API keys

### Registered User without Keys:
1. Logs in, tries to generate
2. Gets quality demo response
3. Clear CTA: "Add your Gemini API key in Settings"
4. One-click navigation to API key manager

### Registered User with Keys:
1. Full AI-powered generation
2. Uses their own API keys
3. No interaction with demo mode
4. Can optionally preview demo mode

## Conclusion

This architecture provides the best of both worlds: a low-friction entry point for new users and a professional user-owned API key system for registered users.

   ```typescript
   import { UserApiKeyManager } from "./userApiKeyManager";
   import { EnhancedDemoMode, type DemoPromptOptions } from "./enhancedDemoMode";
   import { DatabaseStorage } from "../databaseStorage";
   ```

2. **Extend GeneratedPromptResult Interface**:
   ```typescript
   export interface GeneratedPromptResult {
     generatedPrompt: string;
     wordCount: number;
     qualityScore: number;
     title: string;
     isDemoMode?: boolean;        // NEW
     demoMessage?: string;        // NEW
     callToAction?: string;       // NEW
   }
   ```

3. **Add UserContext Interface**:
   ```typescript
   export interface UserContext {
     userId?: string;

   - Change signature to accept optional `UserContext` parameter
   - Implement new priority system: User Keys → Enhanced Demo → System Keys (optional)
   - Replace old demo mode with EnhancedDemoMode service
   - Add helper function `generateWithUserClient()` for user-specific API calls

5. **Create New Helper Function**:
   ```typescript
   async function generateWithUserClient(
     request: GeneratePromptRequest, 
     client: OpenAI | Anthropic | GoogleGenerativeAI, 
     targetModel: string
   ): Promise<GeneratedPromptResult>
   ```

### ✅ Recently Completed Phases

   };
   ```

3. **Smart Persistence Logic**: Different handling for demo vs regular mode
   ```typescript
   if (!result.isDemoMode && req.userId) {
     // Save to database for authenticated users with real AI generation
     savedPrompt = await userStorage.createPrompt(promptData);
   } else {
     // Demo mode: don't save, provide guidance messaging
     response.demoInfo = { isDemoMode, message, callToAction };
   }
   ```

### ✅ Recently Completed Phases
