# Password Recovery System Implementation

## Goal

Implement a secure and user-friendly password recovery system that allows users who have forgotten their password to safely reset it via email verification. This feature is critical for user retention and account accessibility, ensuring users are never permanently locked out of their accounts.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Users can request a password reset by entering their email address
- System sends a secure, time-limited reset link to the user's email
- Users can set a new password using the reset link
- Old sessions are invalidated after successful password reset
- Clear user feedback throughout the process

### Security Requirements
- Tokens must be cryptographically secure and unpredictable
- Reset links expire after 30 minutes
- Tokens are single-use only
- System doesn't reveal whether an email exists in the database
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- All tokens are hashed before storage
- Password strength validation on reset

### User Experience Requirements
- Clear "Forgot Password?" link on login page
- Professional email templates with clear instructions
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Success/error notifications
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessible forms with proper labels and ARIA attributes

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Email Service**: Resend (modern email API with React Email support)
- **Token Generation**: Node.js crypto module for secure random tokens
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for token storage
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, shadcn/ui components
- **Security**: bcrypt for password hashing, SHA-256 for token hashing

### Data Flow
1. User clicks "Forgot Password?" on login form
2. User enters email address and submits request
3. Backend validates email and generates secure token
4. Token is hashed and stored in database with expiry
5. Email is sent via Resend with reset link
6. User clicks link and is directed to reset form
7. User enters new password
8. Backend validates token and updates password
9. Token is marked as used
10. User is redirected to login with success message

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Create `password_reset_tokens` table schema
- ✅ Add migration for new table
- ✅ Define TypeScript types and Zod schemas

#### Phase 1 Completion Details (Completed: Aug 30, 2025)

**What was implemented:**
1. Added `passwordResetTokens` table to `shared/schema.ts` with fields:
   - `id`: UUID primary key
   - `userId`: Foreign key to users table with cascade delete
   - `token`: Text field for storing hashed token
   - `expiresAt`: Timestamp for token expiration
   - `used`: Boolean flag for single-use enforcement
   - `createdAt`: Timestamp for token creation

2. Created TypeScript types and Zod schemas:
   - `InsertPasswordResetToken` and `PasswordResetToken` types
   - `forgotPasswordSchema` for email validation
   - `resetPasswordSchema` for token and new password validation

3. Database migration executed successfully with:
   - Table creation with all required fields
   - Foreign key constraint to users table
   - Performance indexes on `user_id`, `token`, and `expires_at`

**Issues Encountered:**
1. **Drizzle Kit Push Interactive Prompt**: When running `npm run db:push`, Drizzle Kit presented an interactive prompt asking whether to create the table or rename from `user_sessions`, blocking automated migration.

**Remediation Steps:**
1. Generated migration file using `npx drizzle-kit generate` which created `0000_freezing_shocker.sql`
2. Created custom migration file `0001_add_password_reset_tokens.sql` with only the new table creation
3. Executed migration directly using `psql` command to bypass interactive prompt
4. Verified table creation with `\d password_reset_tokens` command

**Verification:**
- Table successfully created with all columns, indexes, and foreign key constraints
- Schema properly integrated with Drizzle ORM types
- All TypeScript types and Zod schemas properly exported

#### Phase 2 Completion Details (Completed: Aug 30, 2025)
