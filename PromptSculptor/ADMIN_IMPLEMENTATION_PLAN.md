**🔍 Security Event Detection System**:

**Event Types & Severity Classification**:
- **`password_reset_request`** (Low) - Normal password reset requests
- **`password_reset_success`** (Medium) - Successful password resets 
- **`password_reset_failure`** (Medium) - Failed password reset attempts
- **`rate_limit_exceeded`** (High) - Rate limiting violations indicating potential abuse
- **`invalid_token_attempt`** (High) - Invalid token usage attempts (potential brute force)
- **`suspicious_activity`** (Critical) - Detected suspicious behavior patterns

**Critical Event Detection**:
Critical events are automatically detected based on:
- **Multiple Failed Attempts**: >5 failed attempts from same IP triggers critical status
- **Rate Limit Violations**: >10 rate limit hits indicates potential DDoS/abuse
- **Token Brute Force**: Repeated invalid token attempts suggest attack patterns
- **Suspicious Patterns**: Unusual activity combinations across multiple event types

**Threat Scoring Algorithm**:
The AI-powered threat detection calculates risk scores using:
```
Risk Score = (Critical Events × 25) + (High Events × 15) + (Rate Limits × 10) + (Suspicious × 20)
Capped at 100, with color-coded threat levels:
- 0-24: Low (Green) - Normal operation
- 25-49: Medium (Yellow) - Monitoring advised  
- 50-74: High (Orange) - Investigation recommended
- 75-100: Critical (Red) - Immediate attention required
```

**Authentication Monitoring**:
- **IP-based Analysis**: Groups failed attempts by source IP address
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects repeated failures across multiple event types
- **Geographic Tracking**: IP addresses tracked for geographic analysis
- **Time-based Analysis**: Recent activity emphasized in threat calculations

**Automated Recommendations**:
The system generates contextual recommendations:
- **Critical Events**: "Review critical security events immediately"
- **Rate Limiting**: "High rate limiting activity - investigate traffic sources"
- **Token Attacks**: "Multiple invalid token attempts - possible brute force attack"
- **Normal Operation**: "No security events - system operating normally"

**Real-time Updates**:
- **Auto-refresh**: Security events refresh every 60 seconds
- **Manual Refresh**: Instant refresh capability with user feedback
- **Live Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring service running on backend
- **Event Logging**: All security events logged with timestamps and IP tracking

- **Real-time Simulation**: Current "real-time" metrics use client-side variance simulation for demo purposes
- **Production Implementation**: Real-time data should be pulled from actual database queries with proper aggregation
- **Custom Metrics Generation**: Prompts per day, template usage, engagement trends, and API adoption calculated from existing user activity data
- **Auto-refresh**: Configurable intervals (manual/5m/15m/1h) with countdown timers and automatic data fetching

**Interactive Charts:**
- **Recharts Integration**: Professional charts with hover tooltips, zoom capabilities, and responsive design
- **Chart Types**: Area charts (user growth), line charts (engagement), bar charts (template usage), pie charts (API adoption)
- **Date Filtering**: Custom date ranges with preset options (7d/14d/30d/60d/90d) using shadcn/ui Calendar component
- **Tab Navigation**: Organized into Growth, Engagement, Templates, and API Keys sections

**Data Export System:**

- **JSON Export**: Complete data structure with metadata, timestamps, and nested analytics
- **File Generation**: Client-side blob creation with automatic download links
- **Export Metadata**: Includes export date, data size, record counts, and selected date range

### System Administration (`/app/admin/settings`)

**System Status Monitoring:**
- **Health Checks**: Reads from existing `/api/monitoring/health` endpoint to determine database, email, and security status
- **Resource Monitoring**: **SIMULATED** - Disk usage (45GB/100GB) and memory usage (2.8GB/8GB) are hardcoded demo values
- **Production Implementation**: Should integrate with actual system monitoring (e.g., Node.js `process.memoryUsage()`, disk usage via `fs.statSync()`)
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded health indicators with real-time status updates

**Token Management System:**
- **Data Source**: Reads from `/api/monitoring/metrics` endpoint for token statistics
- **Cleanup Functionality**: Calls `/api/monitoring/cleanup-tokens` endpoint to remove expired tokens
- **Health Assessment**: Categorizes token health (healthy <10, warning 10-20, critical >20 expired tokens)
- **Lifecycle Information**: Displays token expiry (30 minutes), usage tracking, and cleanup recommendations

**Email System Monitoring:**
- **Service Status**: Reads email service health from `/api/monitoring/health` endpoint
- **Delivery Metrics**: Calculates success rates from password reset metrics data
- **Test Functionality**: **SIMULATED** - Email delivery test is currently a mock function with random success/failure
- **Production Implementation**: Should integrate with actual email service testing (send test email to admin address)

**Configuration Management:**
- **Settings Categories**: Security (rate limiting, session timeouts), Email (templates, retry attempts), Database (backups, cleanup), System (logging, analytics)
- **Current State**: Configuration changes are **SIMULATED** - settings are stored in component state only
- **Production Implementation**: Should persist settings to database and apply to actual system configuration
- **Maintenance Mode**: Currently frontend-only toggle - production should restrict API access for non-admin users

**Maintenance Tools:**
- **Resource Monitoring**: **HARDCODED** - Disk (45% usage) and memory (35% usage) values are static demo data
- **Maintenance Tasks**: **SIMULATED** - All tasks (database optimize, cache clear, system diagnostic, backup) are mock operations with random timing
- **Production Implementation**: Should integrate with actual system operations:
  - Database optimization: SQL ANALYZE/VACUUM operations
  - Cache clearing: Redis/memory cache clearing
  - System diagnostics: Health checks, log analysis, performance metrics
  - Database backup: pg_dump or similar backup operations
- **Task Results**: Currently show simulated results (freed space, optimization counts) - should show actual operation results

### Real-time Features & Auto-refresh

**Data Refresh System:**
- **Health Dashboard**: 30-second auto-refresh of system health data
- **Security Monitoring**: 60-second auto-refresh of security events
- **User Analytics**: 5-minute auto-refresh of user metrics
- **Database Analytics**: Configurable refresh intervals with countdown display
- **Manual Refresh**: Immediate data reload with user feedback toasts

**"Real-time" Metrics Simulation:**
- **Current Implementation**: Uses `Math.random()` variance (±10%) to simulate live data changes
- **Production Replacement**: Should query actual live metrics from database aggregation queries
- **Metrics Tracked**: Active users, daily prompts, API keys configured, retention rates
- **Update Frequency**: Should reflect actual system activity, not simulated changes

### Security & Authentication

**API Key Authentication:**
- **Current System**: Uses `ADMIN_API_KEY` environment variable for admin access
- **Header Validation**: All admin endpoints require `x-admin-api-key` header
- **Session Management**: 2-hour session timeout with automatic logout
- **Future Migration**: Phase 5 will convert to password + JWT token system

**Access Control:**
- **Route Protection**: All admin routes wrapped in `AdminProtectedRoute` component
- **Session Validation**: Periodic session validity checks with automatic logout
- **Maintenance Mode**: When enabled, should restrict regular user access (currently frontend-only)

### Performance & Scalability

**Caching Strategy:**
- **React Query**: Used for API data caching with appropriate stale times
